Hello! My name is Joseph Michaels, and I am a programmer with many areas of interest, including Machine Learning, UI design, simulations, scientific computing, web development, and developer tools. I currently reside in Seattle, Washington.

Outside of technology, I also enjoy travel, meeting new and interesting people, and studying foreign languages, history, and culture.
