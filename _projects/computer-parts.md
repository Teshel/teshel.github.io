Team project I did for a databases class. We designed the idea of a site where you can spec out a computer system from a list of possible parts. I already had some experience making a MVC web app in Ruby on Rails, but we primarily used Java in class and the other team members didn't know Ruby, so I chose Java and the Play! framework. I ended up doing virtually all of the coding. `School Project` `Java` `Play! Framework` `jQueryUI`
